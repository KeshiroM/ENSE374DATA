# Project Idea:
As a group, we planned to create a web-based platform which will help users/customers to find artists (specifically with a similar Genre, Artist) according to their personal interests and preference rather than just their listening history.
# Project background/Business Opportunity:

This can be a business opportunity as these problems exist with some popular music apps like Spotify, etc. Spotify can be irritating sometimes with how its algorithms hops between the different genres of music. I believe this problem is very common for Spotify users and so this platform can be a blessing to many music lovers. (Hopefully) Solving a problem faced by many users can attract and increase the usage of this web-based software and hence there is a high chance of business opportunity.
