Project Idea:

Creating a web-based platform which will help users/customers to find music (specifically with a similar Genre, Artist) according to their personal interests and preference rather than user history.

Project background/Business Opportunity:

We believe the need for such a platform is way too underrated. Music plays a vital role in human life. People listen to music when they work out, Listening to music relaxes and satisfies the mind, and many more. To help all these people to enjoy the music according to the preferred genre and artist, rather than being stuck under an algorithm of a music app, we as a group are planning to create software that will understand the user's interest and provide 'only' similar Artists under the same genre. Upon the interest of the users, by every search or click the software will understand and store the user's preferences and therefore it becomes a very personalized software for a specific music taste.

This can be a business opportunity as these problems exist with some popular music apps like Spotify, etc. Spotify can be irritating sometimes with how its algorithms hops between the different genres of music. I believe this problem is very common for Spotify users and so this platform can be a blessing to many music lovers. (Hopefully) Solving a problem faced by many users can attract and increase the usage of this web-based software and hence there is a high chance of business opportunity.
